      <p>I gave a short <a href="http://www.meetup.com/DublinJS/events/222570156/"> Elm talk</a>  to the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/DublinJS/"> DublinJS meetup,</a>  extolling the virtues of functional programming.</p><p> To be honest, I was expecting a very hostile audience but it was super friendly (yay!) and I got really excellent questions. There should be video of that, so hopefully if you can scrub past me you can get to the questions :)</p><p> You can find my slides and examples on <a href="https://github.com/micktwomey/elm-dublinjs"> Github</a>  . You can view the slides on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/micktwomey/elm-dublinjs"> SlideShare</a>  .</p><p> Most importantly, I really recommend watching Evan’s talk, it’s fun and really gives you the feel for Elm’s philosophy, and is much better than my talk :)</p><p> <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="480" scrolling="no" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/oYk8CKH7OhE?wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1" width="854"></iframe></p>
