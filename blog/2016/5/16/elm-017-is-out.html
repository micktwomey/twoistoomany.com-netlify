      <p>The long awaited update to Elm is out, <a href="http://elm-lang.org/blog/farewell-to-frp"> 0.17</a>  . This release features a huge simplification of aspects which people (ok, me) found confusing, making it much easier to wire together components. Elm seems to be moving towards a more Erlang like experience for concurrency, which isn’t a bad thing :)</p><p> Apart from the <a href="http://elm-lang.org/blog/farewell-to-frp"> blog post</a>  introducing it here are a few other places detailing the changes you might need to make to migrate from older versions:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.lambdacat.com/migrating-from-elm-0-16-to-0-17-from-startapp/"> Migrating from Elm 0.16 to 0.17 - from StartApp</a>  (Claudia will be following up with more posts for folks who need more than the StartApp stuff).</li><li><a href="http://noredink.github.io/posts/signalsmigration.html"> Migrating signal usage from Elm 0.16 to 0.17.</a></li></ul><h2> Talk on 0.17</h2><p> I’ll also be giving an <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Elm-User-Group-Dublin/events/230200405/"> introduction to 0.17</a>  in the next <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Elm-User-Group-Dublin/"> Dublin Elm Meetup</a>  on Tuesday May 24th 2016. I’ll basically be giving an introduction to Elm with Signals and Mailboxes removed (yay! The confusing bits! No more foldp!).</p>
