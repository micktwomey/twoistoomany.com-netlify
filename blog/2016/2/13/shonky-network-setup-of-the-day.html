      <p>So, here I am helping another <a href="https://www.gamecraft.it/events/i-heart-you-gamecraft-2016/"> GameCraft</a>  , this time I’m hoping to write a simple game using my shiny new <a href="http://flotil.la/"> Flotilla</a>  on my Raspberry Pis.</p><p> First problem: connecting to the network for stuff. The GameCraft is graciously being hosted by <a href="http://www.dit.ie/"> DIT</a>  in their excellent new <a href="http://www.dit.ie/grangegorman/"> Grangegorman campus</a>  . They have also given us access to the Wifi. The problem is it’s 801.x so it’s awkward to configure using WPA supplicant on a Pi.</p><p> Second problem: To get around this I want to share the wifi from my Macbook over an ethernet cable to a wifi router I brought for just such an occasion. The problem here is OS X won’t share an 801.x connection.</p><p> Convoluted solution: Connect to the wifi from my Mac, then turn on my VPN connection (with send all traffic turned on), then share  <em> that</em> connection to my Wifi router, which my Pis can connect to. Simples.</p><p> Bonus: For some reason the Irish VPN endpoint isn’t working so I’m routing via the UK.</p><p> Ok, I could just simply connect the Pis to my router and my laptop to that, but then I’d lose the ability to download all the code I forgot to download in advance :)</p>
