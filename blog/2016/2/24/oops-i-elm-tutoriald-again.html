      <p>So I got “tricked” into running another <a href="http://elm-lang.org/"> Elm</a>  tutorial.</p><p> This time I tried to focus more on Signals and the graphics, and less on HTML.</p><p> Overall I think it went better, but everyone (including me) ran out of steam after the food arrived, so I should have stopped it there. Future lesson: Elm basics + Signals in tutorial 1, Models, updates and maybe Effects in tutorial 2. I think I can crack this Elm teaching thing soon.</p><p> Thanks to <a href="http://www.meetup.com/FunctionalKats/"> Functional Kats</a>  for putting up with, I mean, hosting me :)</p><p> You can find all my slides, exercises and code in <a href="https://github.com/micktwomey/elm-functionalkats-tutorial"> https://github.com/micktwomey/elm-functionalkats-tutorial</a></p>
