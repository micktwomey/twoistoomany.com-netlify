      <p>I gave a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/pythonireland/events/221222978/"> talk at Python Ireland</a>  about using Mesos, Django, Aurora and CircleCI together for deployment bliss. These are some of my notes.</p><h1> Setting up</h1><p> First follow the <a href="http://aurora.apache.org/documentation/latest/vagrant/"> Aurora Vagrant instructions</a>  to set up Aurora. This gets you a working Zookeeper, Mesos master + slave and Aurora itself. I tried using Ansible to jinny up my own little cluster but that was a little bit too much to get going while trying to understand the Aurora build process at the same time :)</p><p> So the first step was a vagrant up.</p><p> Next I installed a few useful packages:</p><pre>apt-get install python-dev ntp htop unzip</pre><p> Then some useful python stuff:</p><pre>curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | sudo python<br/>sudo /usr/local/bin/pip2.7 install -U setuptools pip wheel virtualenv awscli</pre><p> These bits were needed for running my Django app in virtualenvs (one per Mesos container). Normally I’d advocate using nothing from the host machine (so put  <em> everything</em> you need in the slug or use a container), but this is handier for a demo :)</p><h1> The Django Code</h1><p> You can find a trivial Django app I called Acaversity here: <a href="http://'s a"> https://github.com/micktwomey/acaversity</a>  . It’s a really small Django app, the most interesting bit is the <a href="https://github.com/micktwomey/acaversity/blob/master/circle.yml"> circle.yml</a>  .</p><p> This is used to build the app in CircleCI, you can see the latest builds <a href="https://circleci.com/gh/micktwomey/acaversity"> here</a>  .</p><p> The general build process is:</p><ol><li>Pip install and test as normal</li><li>Make a slug directory</li><li>Put all the wheel dependencies in there</li><li>Tar it up</li><li>Upload the slug to S3</li></ol><p> The key missing bit here is some kind of hook which pokes the server controlling the aurora deployment config (more on that later). A really simple approach is to write out a config and upload that, keeping it together with the code (and thus allowing for branching). Then you fetch and run that config.</p><p> The reason I use slugs is the Aurora deployment doesn’t have to know what you are doing, all it needs to know is to untar, run bin/setup.sh and then bin/start.sh. This makes it possible to completely switch around what you are doing to start a process.</p><h1> Aurora</h1><p> Apart from setting up Aurora above the other bit you need is the acaversity.aurora (and S3 keys from me ;)). I have the code below, and <a href="/s/acaversity.aurora"> here</a>  as well.</p><p> To do the deploy you ssh onto the vagrant box with aurora and run something like this to deploy.</p><pre>aurora update start devcluster/www-data/devel/acaversity acaversity.aurora</pre><p> That’s pretty much it, this is most of what I demoed (I plan to keep working on this stack to make a more fully fledged drop in stack people can just use).</p><h2> acaversity.aurora</h2>
