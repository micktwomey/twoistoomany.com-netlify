      <p>I figure it’s always funny to list things that currently interest you and then laugh at yourself a few years later. So here’s my July 2015 selection:</p><h1> Programming Languages</h1><ul><li><a href="http://fsharp.org"> F#</a></li><li><a href="http://www.rust-lang.org"> Rust</a></li><li><a href="http://elm-lang.org"> Elm</a></li><li><a href="https://golang.org"> Go</a></li><li><a href="http://clojure.org"> Clojure</a></li></ul><p> Lots os hip new languages there, so far I’ve probably spent the most time trying to write F# and Clojure, and I’ve read the most Go (since everything is written in that these days).</p><p> Python is always my goto language, but I’m really trying to explore languages with different approaches to to typing.</p><h1> Tools / Projects</h1><ul><li>Mesos / Aurora (I even gave a <a href="/blog/2015/7/16/mesos-django-and-aurora-and-circleci-too"> talk</a>  on them :))</li><li><a href="https://nixos.org/nix/"> Nix</a></li><li><a href="https://vaultproject.io"> Vault</a></li></ul><p> I’m still trying to find that ideal mix of stuff which lets a company manage development and deployment while keeping its sanity. Also applies to personal projects (though my scale is smaller and cheaper).</p><h1> Hardware</h1><ul><li>Raspberry Pi &amp; Arduino (as always)</li><li><a href="http://shop.keyboard.io"> Keyboardio Model 01</a></li><li>Wii U</li></ul><p> I’m still tinkering with my Raspberry Pi collection, I think I’ve accumulated enough hardware to actually make something :)</p><p> I’d love a Model 01 keyboard, but I want to hear more reviews before I invest in an expensive keyboard. However it looks like it might be a good investment to save my wrists :)</p><p> I’d live a Wii U mostly to play Splatoon, and it’d really annoy @theothernt.</p>
