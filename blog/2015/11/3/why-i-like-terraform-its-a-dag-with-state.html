      <p>After a fairly frustrating evening trying to get a service configured on a pet project (I won, <a href="https://www.nomadproject.io"> Nomad</a>  is now running) I’ve realised what’s been bugging me about <a href="http://www.ansible.com"> Ansible</a>  (I think this applies to Chef, Puppet and Salt too, don’t quote me on that though): it doesn’t store any state, nor does it come up with a plan.</p><p> Compare to <a href="https://terraform.io"> Terraform</a>  , which is both a joy to use and frustrating in how deliberately limited it is. It keeps a snapshot of server state, compares the current server state to that and comes up with a plan of action. You can even save that plan and pass it around for future application by someone else. It’s essentially a Makefile for your servers (it even lets you write the DAG to <a href="http://www.graphviz.org"> Graphviz</a>  for visualisation).</p><p> It’s also fast, I can quickly see what my edits will do. Compare to Ansible where I wind up commenting out swathes of my tasks to get to the spot I’m debugging quickly. Yeah, yeah, tags, I know. I shouldn’t have to do this stuff ahead of time.</p><p> With state you can spot deletions too, solving that annoying problem of having to keep a “file: ... state=absent” line around to remove mistakes.</p><p> With a DAG you can spot config cycles too, and order tasks correctly. Just tonight I had an impossible problem where I was switching bind ports of a service but a command to talk to it was invoked before the restart handler in Ansible. I commented out the line, ran the play and uncommented it again.</p><p> All in all, yay Terraform, boo-erns Ansible. Though as I’ve said many times before, Ansible is the least worst option out there when it comes to config management like this.</p><p> I think it’s time for me to bake more stuff into images with Packer just so I can use Terraform more :)</p>
